# Bare metal micro:bit

Source code for use with the book 'Bare Metal micro:bit'.

This copy of the repository has code that suits the newer Version
2 of the BBC micro:bit, based on the Nordic nRF52833 chip.  See
the [other repository](http://github.com/Spivoxity/baremetal-v1) for
code that runs on the Version 1 board.

Draft material for the book will appear at

https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/baremetal

The copy of this repository that appears on GitHub is an exact copy of
the one that appears at

https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/git/baremetal-v2.git.

The book is in a rapid phase of evolution at present, and the code and
text will not always be in sync -- in particular, code will appear
here for testing while the corresponding chapter is still being
written.
